# Awesome YouTubers voting system

## How to vote a YouTuber?

It's as easy as clicking one of the two options that are located at the right-most part of the
YouTuber's name on the [list](../readme.md). You'll be redirected to the Awesome YouTubers
voting system website. You'll see the name of the YouTuber and the vote you gave him, as well
as a prompt to write the reason why you choose to upvote or downvote the YouTuber. If you don't
want to provide any, don't type anything, though it's recommended to have an
idea of your chose. This is anonymous and does not require authentication.

If you think the YouTuber is awesome, you can upvote the channel. If not, you can downvote the
channel. When you upvote a channel you sum 1 to its calification, whereas when you downvote it
you substract 1 from its calification. The vote the YouTuber has appears next to the icons.
The value starts at 0 and goes above and below it according to the votes.

## How does it work?

Each YouTuber has two options (upvote and downvote) on the YouTuber's name line. The options
each YouTuber has are linked to the Awesome YouTubers voting system website (see the source
in this folder) by the name of the YouTuber. When you click, the website opens and you get
prompted to write why you decided the vote you are giving (if you don't want to tell, just
don't type anything). When you click on "Submit vote" your vote (upvote = +1 or downvote = -1)
and your opinion get sent to a database when the scores are stored. They then get printed in
the [readme.md](../readme.md) file for others to see.

## Motivation

Despite having already a [discussion about YouTubers](https://github.com/JoseDeFreitas/awesome-youtubers/discussions/32)
(specifically the ones that according to the community should be removed from the list for x or y
reasons) this voting system makes it easier, anonymous, and fair to decide the place a YouTuber has
on this list. All the YouTubers added get revised by me (I check whether the information the
contributor provided matches and I watch some videos looking for well explanations, good audio and
video quality, coverage of the topics it explains, among others), but, of course, I'm only one person,
so I think being able to receive opinions from all users is a good way to filter and have truly
awesome content based on the community's opinion.
