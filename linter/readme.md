# Awesome YouTubers linter

The awesome-youtubers linter is a workflow that checks the layout of the pull requests opened. This helps the contributors show if
something in the layout is not formatted correctly so it can be fixed. This linter was created in order to keep the format of the
list without breaking the layouts (images, new lines, etc.)

## Rules

The rules that the linter follows are:

- Trailing `\` at the end of the name and link of the YouTuber.
- Trailing `\` at the end of the "Content about" section.
- Trailing `\` at the end of the "Featured playlists" section.
- Spaces between badges.
- Spaces between "Content about" words (including `,`).
- Spaces between "Featured playlists" words (including `,`).
- Links formatted correctly in the markdown syntax (`[text](link)`)
